                <p>Tracer was one of the first twelve Overwatch characters introduced at BlizzCon in 2014. Her in-game character model notably features tight orange pants, goggles, and Crocs-like shoes. Her 
                design is based upon an element from Blizzard's canceled project, Titan. Overwatch's game director Jeff Kaplan said Titan included a class of character called "Jumper", which developed into Tracer because 
                Overwatch focuses on creating individual characters instead of generic classes. The Jumper class was depicted as male in most of the concept artwork and its player version. Like Tracer in Overwatch, the 
                Jumper was equipped with the Blink and Recall abilities, as well as a Pulse bomb and dual-wielding machine pistols. The design of Tracer's pistols were influenced by the G18 pistols featured in Call of 
                Duty: Modern Warfare 2</p>

            <p>Reaper, real name Gabriel Reyes, is an American mercenary and terrorist, originally a founding member of Overwatch, now a leading member of Talon. He is attired in a black hooded trenchcoat with a white 
            skull mask and wields twin Hellfire Shotguns. His abilities are Shadow Step, a medium-range line of sight teleport, and Wraith Form, a brief period of invincibility and speed increase. He was able to heal 
            himself by consuming the souls of fallen enemies, visible as red burning "Soul Globes" on the ground but later was changed to a passive ability called The Reaping which allows him to steal a 30% heal from the 
            damage he deals. Reaper's ultimate ability is Death Blossom, a twin shotgun gun kata which deals massive damage in a short radius around him.</p>

            <p>Hanzo, full name Hanzo Shimada, is a Japanese archer, assassin and mercenary. He wields the Storm Bow and is equipped with specialized arrows, including Sonic Arrows to detect enemies and Storm Arrows to 
            fire six weaker shots in rapid succession. He is also able to Wall Climb, enabling him to reach vantage points, and Lunge forward while in mid-air. His ultimate ability is Dragonstrike, in which he unleashes a 
            spiraling spirit dragon that can travel through obstacles to deal damage in a straight line. Hanzo is the elder brother of Genji, and the heir to the head of the Shimada clan. He was trained from an early age 
            to take over the clan, becoming a skilled warrior and marksman, as well as a strategist. When his father died, Hanzo was directed by the clan elders to bring Genji into line; and when Genji refused, the two 
            brothers battled, resulting in what appeared to be Genji's death. Guilty and grief-stricken, Hanzo abandoned the clan and traveled the world in an effort to restore his honor.</p>

            <p>Genji, full name Genji Shimada, is a Japanese cyborg ninja. His main attack method is to throw three Shurikens, either in quick succession or simultaneously in a horizontal spread. His abilities are Swift 
            Strike, a quick dashing lunge with good range, and Deflect, a defensive stance that briefly ricochets projectiles back at enemies with his wakizashi. His Cyber-Agility allows him to double-jump and run up 
            walls. Genji's ultimate ability is Dragonblade, during which Genji unsheathes the odachi on his back and delivers powerful, sweeping melee attacks. In his origin story, Genji transforms from a slacker to a 
            superhero. His family—the Japanese Shimada crime family—ordered his eldest brother Hanzo to kill Genji for his selfish and hedonistic behavior (as shown in the short Dragons and referenced in-game Hanamura map 
            by a shrine devoted to Genji</p>
