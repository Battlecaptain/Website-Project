                <p>Tracer was one of the first twelve Overwatch characters introduced at BlizzCon in 2014. Her in-game character model notably features tight orange pants, goggles, and Crocs-like shoes. Her 
                design is based upon an element from Blizzard's canceled project, Titan. Overwatch's game director Jeff Kaplan said Titan included a class of character called "Jumper", which developed into Tracer because 
                Overwatch focuses on creating individual characters instead of generic classes. The Jumper class was depicted as male in most of the concept artwork and its player version. Like Tracer in Overwatch, the 
                Jumper was equipped with the Blink and Recall abilities, as well as a Pulse bomb and dual-wielding machine pistols. The design of Tracer's pistols were influenced by the G18 pistols featured in Call of 
                Duty: Modern Warfare 2</p>
