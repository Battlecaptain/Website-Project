                <p>Tracer was one of the first twelve Overwatch characters introduced at BlizzCon in 2014. Her in-game character model notably features tight orange pants, goggles, and Crocs-like shoes. Her 
                design is based upon an element from Blizzard's canceled project, Titan. Overwatch's game director Jeff Kaplan said Titan included a class of character called "Jumper", which developed into Tracer because 
                Overwatch focuses on creating individual characters instead of generic classes. The Jumper class was depicted as male in most of the concept artwork and its player version. Like Tracer in Overwatch, the 
                Jumper was equipped with the Blink and Recall abilities, as well as a Pulse bomb and dual-wielding machine pistols. The design of Tracer's pistols were influenced by the G18 pistols featured in Call of 
                Duty: Modern Warfare 2</p>

            <p>Lúcio, full name Lúcio Correia dos Santos, is a Brazilian DJ and freedom fighter. He is equipped with futuristic roller blades that allow him to skate on walls (Wall Ride), and is armed with a Sonic 
            Amplifier gun that can damage enemies or knock them back with Soundwaves. He uses music to either heal his teammates or increase their movement speed (Crossfade), and can amplify his music at will to boost the 
            effects (Amp It Up). His ultimate ability, Sound Barrier, grants powerful temporary shielding to himself and nearby allies. Jeff Kaplan described Lucio's origins based on the bard class from classic tabletop 
            role-playing games, able to cast auras on their party. Lúcio Correia dos Santos grew up in Rio de Janeiro during the financial upheaval caused by the Omnic Crisis.</p>

            <p>Ashe, full name Elizabeth Caledonia "Calamity" Ashe, is an American gunslinger and leader of the Deadlock Gang, a band of arms-trafficking outlaws based in Arizona. Her main weapon is The Viper, a lever 
            action repeating rifle that can be used for short-ranged quick fire or sighted long shots. She also carries a Coach gun which can knock enemies back and propel her up or away from obstacles as well as enable 
            limited rocket jumping, and can throw Dynamite bundles that detonate after a short delay or immediately when shot with her rifle, setting opponents on fire. Her ultimate ability summons B.O.B., her Omnic 
            butler/bodyguard, who charges forward to knock enemies into the air before laying down suppressive fire with his built-in arm cannons. Unlike deployable assets from other heroes, such as Torbjörn's turrets, 
            B.O.B. serves as a temporary seventh player on the team until his health is exhausted, and thus is able to capture or challenge objectives, and can be healed by allies.</p>

            <p>Ana, full name Ana Amari (Arabic: أنا أمري‎, romanized: 'ana 'amri), is an Egyptian sniper and bounty hunter, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. She wields a Biotic Rifle loaded with smart darts that 
            damage enemies and heal allies, as well as a sidearm that fires Sleep Darts. She also carries Biotic Grenades that disable enemy healing and boost ally healing. Her ultimate ability is Nano Boost, which grants 
            an attack and defense boost to a teammate hero. Hailing from Cairo, Ana Amari was considered the best sniper in the world, and rushed in to support the unprepared Egyptian defense forces during the Omnic 
            Crisis. Her marksmanship and her critical decision-making skills led to her being recruited by Overwatch, and she served for many years as Jack Morrison's second-in-command during the conflict, while trying to 
            be a mother to her daughter, Fareeha.</p>

            <p>Baptiste, full name Jean-Baptiste Augustin, is a Haitian combat medic and former operative of Talon. His main weapon is a Medic SMG, a submachine gun alongside a secondary Biotic Launcher that fires 
            projectiles that heal allies in their area of effect. As a passive ability, Baptiste's Exo Boots allow him to jump higher after crouching. His active abilities includes a Regenerative Burst that heals himself 
            and nearby allies over a short period of time, and an Immortality Field device that prevents teammates from dying while in range, but the device itself can be destroyed prematurely. His ultimate is an 
            Amplification Matrix that increases damage and healing effects of allies' shots that pass through it. Originally from Tortuga, Baptiste was among the thirty million children orphaned by the Omnic Crisis.</p>

            <p>Doomfist, real name Akande Ogundimu, is both the name of the titular cybernetic gauntlet and the title of its wielder, currently the Nigerian-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned 
            mercenary. He has a short-range Hand Cannon on his off-hand that fires shotgun-like bursts and regenerates ammo over time, but most of his abilities come through melee attacks from the Doomfist Gauntlet. 
            Doomfist can charge up a Rocket Punch that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a Seismic Slam that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a Rising Uppercut that 
            greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (The Best Defense...). Doomfist's ultimate ability is named Meteor Strike, 
            allowing him to jump into the air and slam the ground, damaging all enemies in a range around that point and pushing them back a short distance.</p>

            <p>Echo is a female Omnic created by Dr. Mina Liao after the Omnic Crisis. Her primary attack is a Tri-Shot that is a set of three projectiles at a time, and she can fire a Sticky Bomb that does initial damage

            half-health, including barriers. She also has a Flight ability that can launch her into the air, and her Glide passive ability allows her to hover and descend at a controlled rate with good horizontal control. 
            Her ultimate ability is Duplicate, which allows Echo to take the appearance and ability of any Hero on the opposing team (save for Echo) for 15 seconds, with an accelerated ultimate gain rate.</p>

            <p>Moira, full name Moira O'Deorain, is an Irish geneticist, a leading member of Talon, and Minister of Genetics for the city of Oasis. Overwatch executive producer Jeff Kaplan has labelled Moira as a "hybrid" 
            hero; while categorized as a support character, she possesses abilities to also deal a high amount of damage. Her main weapon is the Biotic Grasp, which latches on to nearby enemies and drains their health and 
            biotic energy; this biotic energy can then be sprayed out in a cone to heal her allies.[212] Her skills include Fade, allowing her to teleport a short distance, and Biotic Orb, a rebounding sphere that can 
            either heal nearby allies or damage nearby enemies. Her ultimate ability is Coalescence, a beam that heals all allies and injures all opponents it passes, bypassing any barriers that may be in place.</p>
